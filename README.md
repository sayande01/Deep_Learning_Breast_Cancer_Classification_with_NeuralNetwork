Title: "Breast Cancer Classification: Leveraging Deep Learning for Diagnosis"

Description:
In this project, we aim to develop a deep learning model for the classification of breast cancer using neural networks. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning techniques, we seek to create a robust and accurate system capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors from breast tissue images. Through the utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a dataset comprising a diverse range of breast tissue samples, we endeavor to contribute to the advancement of medical diagnostics, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in making more informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to implement a deep learning model using Python and TensorFlow/Keras to classify breast cancer tumors based on histopathological images. Specific goals include:

1. Preprocessing and exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics and ensure its suitability for training the model.
2. Designing and training a convolutional neural network architecture tailored for breast cancer classification, optimizing model performance through experimentation with different network architectures, hyperparameters, and regularization techniques.
3. Evaluating the trained model using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its effectiveness in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
4. Conducting comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the results to gain insights into the model's strengths, limitations, and areas for potential improvement.
5. Documenting the entire process, including code implementation, experimental setup, results, and conclusions, to facilitate reproducibility and knowledge sharing within the scientific community.
